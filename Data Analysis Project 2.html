									<h2>Project Description</h2>
									<p> <span style="font-weight: bold;">Cancer Risk Assessment Calculator:</span>The Cancer Risk Assessment Calculator is an innovative Python-based tool designed to help individuals evaluate their potential risk of developing cancer. Utilizing a user-friendly graphical interface, this tool integrates multiple personal and lifestyle factors—such as age, gender, smoking habits, diet, exercise, family history, and alcohol consumption—to provide a comprehensive risk assessment.</p>
                                    <p>Problem Statement:Cancer is a significant health concern globally, and understanding individual risk factors is crucial for prevention. Traditional risk assessment methods can be complex and inaccessible. This project aims to create a straightforward, interactive calculator that enables users to quickly and easily assess their cancer risk based on relevant personal and lifestyle information.</p>
									<p>KEY FEATURES:
										<p style="margin: 0;font-weight:bold ;">User-Friendly Interface:</p> The calculator employs Python’s Tkinter library to offer an intuitive interface, making it simple for users to enter their details.
										<p style="margin: 0;font-weight:bold ;">Comprehensive Risk Factors:</p> It evaluates a range of risk factors, including age, gender, smoking status, diet quality, exercise habits, family history, and alcohol consumption.
										<p style="margin: 0;font-weight:bold ;">Real-Time Calculation:</p> The tool provides immediate feedback, calculating and displaying the risk level as soon as the user inputs their data.</p>
									<p>TECHNICAL DETAILS:
									    <p style="margin: 0;font-weight: bold;">GUI Development:</p> Built using Python’s Tkinter library, the interface is designed for ease of use.
									    <p style="margin: 0;font-weight: bold;">Input Parameters:</p>
										                 
									                     Gender (Male/Female)
									                     Smoking (Yes/No)
									                     Diet (Healthy/Poor)
									                     Exercise (Yes/No)
									                     Family history of cancer (Yes/No)
									                     Alcohol consumption (None/Low/Moderate/High)
									                     Output: The risk level of developing cancer is displayed based on these parameters.</p>	
									<p>Applications:
									<p style="margin: 0;">1.Healthcare Professionals:</p> Can use this tool to educate and advise patients on lifestyle changes to reduce cancer risk.
									<p style="margin: 0;">2.Personal Health Management:</p> Individuals can assess their own risk and make informed decisions about their health.
							        <p style="margin: 0;">Conclusion:</p>The Cancer Risk Assessment Calculator is a valuable tool for understanding cancer risk, fostering informed health choices, and promoting preventive measures. By encompassing various risk factors, it offers a personalized assessment that aids both individuals and healthcare professionals in proactive health management.</p>

                                            <h2>Problem approach</h2>
                                            <p>Begins with identifying key risk factors scientifically proven to influence cancer risk, including age, gender, smoking habits, dietary habits, physical activity levels, family history of cancer, and alcohol consumption. A user-friendly interface is developed using Python’s Tkinter library to facilitate easy input of these personal details by users. The GUI collects this information through simple forms, allowing users to provide their data via Yes/No options, drop-down lists, or text entries. Behind the scenes, a sophisticated risk calculation algorithm processes this input data, potentially employing weighted factors, statistical models, or machine learning techniques to assess the overall cancer risk accurately. Finally, the calculated risk level is displayed to the user through the GUI, providing them with immediate feedback on their cancer risk based on the entered factors.</p>
